# Applaudo Test API

This API has been develop as a technical test for me as a part of the recluiment process on [Applaudo Studios](https://applaudostudios.com/). It's a REST API for a small snacks store. See the [full list of requirements in the wiki](https://github.com/MarvinBarahona/Applaudo-Test/wiki/Requirements)

Also in the wiki, you can [read more about the project](https://github.com/MarvinBarahona/Applaudo-Test/wiki/About-the-project) and [check the project planning](https://github.com/MarvinBarahona/Applaudo-Test/wiki/Planning)

***
## Technologies
This was develop using NodeJS with its framework Express; and MongoDB as DBMS. [Check the wiki](https://github.com/MarvinBarahona/Applaudo-Test/wiki/Main-technologies-and-packages) for a full list of technologies and packages, with the version used in the development.

***
## Installation
First, be sure you have [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads) and [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) in your system.

Clone or download the project. In the project folder, run the next command:
```
npm install
```

Now, you need to set the environment variables in a file call ".env". You can just duplicate the sample.env file, rename it as just '.env' and use the default values; or you can set in here the values you need to change.

To start the project, run the command :
```
npm run start
```

You should now see the next messages in the console:

See more information of the [installation process and testing the API in the wiki](https://github.com/MarvinBarahona/Applaudo-Test/wiki/Installation)

## Testing the app
In order to facilitate testing this API, there's a database dump in the folder "dump" of the source code. To know how to import test data to your MongoDB database, check the [installation guide in the wiki](https://github.com/MarvinBarahona/Applaudo-Test/wiki/Installation)

Also in the installation guide, is instructions on how to import the [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) collection (on the "postman" folder of this repository) to test the API, both locally and deployed as demo.
